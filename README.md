# Project Title

Semester Project 1 - Community Science Museum

## Description

Community Science Museum is a semester project in school about creating a website for a museum. The target audience of the website is children between the age of 7-15 and families with children. The website is created using HTML and CSS. Every page has its own HTML and CSS file. in the CSS folder there is one file for each page, one for styles that applies to all or more than one page, and it is also an file for media queries to make the website responsive. Images is added in its own folder and contains of all the images used on the website.

### Changes

The project is based on a prototype that was made for this project. The only chnges that has been made from the prototype is that in some places there is used a bigger font size, because the size in the prototype was a bit to small on the phone. There is also made a color change in the info text on the home page. The text "free entrance all days" and "See all our opening hours" is changes to a darker purple color, because the color contrast was only AA colpliant and I wanted it to be AAA colpliant. Other than that, there is no changes to the project relative to the prototype that was made.

### Difficulties

I have struggeled a bit with making the website colorful without it looking messy to fit the targete audience. I first made a design very simple with black text on a white background with just a burgundy color on the logo and header. I found out this was to boring for the children, so I madde another design with more colors, and feel very happy with the outcome.
